Just a small test to upload files to drive.

Make sure to give access of the folder to the service account. Otherwise it will still say that upload was successful but you will not see the file in the drive.

TODO: There can also be another issue that google requires manual authentication. For that, another json file with remember token will be needed. For now it's `working on my machine :)`
